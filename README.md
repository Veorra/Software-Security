# Software-Security
**Patrick Valencia's Portfolio**

1) Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a modern financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. Their main software requirement was something that would help modernize their operations along with the most current and effective software security. 
    
2)What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

What I did particularly well was to identify what was vulnerable and how to fix the presented issues so that those vulnerabilities wouldn’t show up. Additionally I made a vulnerabilities report where I went in depth as to which vulnerabilities were found and their cause/remedies for it. This means that the code was securely written and that the likelihood of a malicious attack would be minimal. This is incredibly important as it allows for both the company and user to have faith that the product they are using is secure and in no way would they have their financial information leaked.

3) What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The main process of working through the vulnerability assessment that I found challenging was deciphering what each vulnerability meant and the reason as to why it was found. Once this information is located, the next challenge is fixing said vulnerability so that it would not be a problem again.

4) How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I approached the need to increase layers of security in a very straightforward manner. I added a bit cypher to the project as an added layer of encryption. With this the user would be more protected with the information they provided. As for a technique I would use, I would first make sure that all the dependencies are up to date. Once then, I would run the maven dependencies to see the list of up to date vulnerable dependencies and what I would need to do to fix them. 

5) How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I made sure that the code was functional by making sure that it executed without errors. Whenever I ran the refracted code, if there were errors it would pop up and it couldn't even execute. As for if any new vulnerabilities were found, I made sure to run a vulnerability test before refactoring and then after and comparing the results. With this I would be able to compare if there were indeed new vulnerabilities introduced or not.

6) What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

7) Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
